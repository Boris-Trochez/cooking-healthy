      You're using a trial token for CookingHealthy!
      <br />
      <br /> Please note that this token has an usage limit, so use it mindfully
      to allow other users to explore as well. The limit is in place due to
      resource costs, including AWS and Gemini AI.

      Once you log in, you can view your token usage and limit in the app
      header.
